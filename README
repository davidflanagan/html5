This is a fork of Aria Stewart's HTML5 parser:

   https://github.com/aredridel/html5

I have modified it to run in the browser instead of Node and to
live in a single file. I've also decoupled it from jsdom so that it
returns a simpler parse tree.

Loading html5parser.js defines HTML5.parseDocument() and HTML5.parseFragment().

The parent project from which this one is forked has a lot of tests, and
is presumably a pretty compliant parser, through I have not run those
tests myself.  

I may have broken the parsing functionality while making my
modifications, but it seems to work okay for me in casual testing.
